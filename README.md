# light-saver

## Introduction
The project is aimed at reducing energy wastage in the form of lighting. The project will use a camera to detect the presence
 of a person in a room and turn the lights on and off accordingly. The problem arises in shared spaces such as school or offices
 whereby the lights may be left switched on thus wasting energy even when not in use. 
The project will implement this using a raspberry pi camera and a relay to control lights. Object detection of people will be done 
using Google Vision API.
